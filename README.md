# Customer-Churn-
<h3>In this project, I have made an end-to-end web application to predict whether a particular customer will churn or not.</h3>
<h3>Customer Churn is the loss of customers or clients. </h3>
<h4>Why is it important ?</h4>
<p>Many companies like telephone service companies, internet service provider or an e-commerce company uses customer churn analysis and customer attrition rate as a key business metric because the cost of retaining an old customer is less than the cost of acquiring a new one. Companies often want to win back defecting customers, because existing customers are more worthy than a new customer.<br>
In this project, I have used a predictive model to predict which customer has high chances to churn. Since, this model provides the company an idea which customer is about to leave or has high chances to leave, it helps the organization to focus more on such customers, change their marketing plans to retain these customers.</p>
